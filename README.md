# Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Project

This project was created for the Unit 3 Project in AP Government and Politics, taught by Mr. Markham.

### Programming Languages

Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS were used to create this website.

### Frameworks

Flask, JQuery, Bootstrap, and Less were used in addition for running the webserver, increasing the functionality of the JavaScript, styling the HTML, and improving the functonality of the CSS, respectively.

### Viewing the Website

You may view the site at [joswin.tk](https://joswin.tk). Please do not copy the code as it is owned by me and I put a lot of effort into it (so pls give me 100 Mr. Markham).

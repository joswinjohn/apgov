                        Jonas Yoder, Wallace Miller and Adin Yutzy, were three Amish parents who would not let their children, Frieda Yoder, Barbara Miller and Vernon Yutzy, go to public school due to religious reasons, because high school teaches things that usually go against their religion. The Amish also typically learn trades like agriculture or craftsmanship around the age of 14-15 through apprenticeship, which is generally around 8th grade. In the case of these children both Frieda Yoder and Barbara Miller were 15, and Vernon Yutzy was 14, although the legal minimum to drop out of school was 16, which caused all three parents to be fined. Jonas Yoder and the other parents of course did not agree with this and filed a lawsuit against Wisconsin, which lost in multiple courts and appealed every time, until it finally won in the Wisconsin supreme court. This time Wisconsin appealed to the US Supreme Court, which was accepted.

                        Chief Justice Warren Burger was selected by President Nixon who although Republican was not heavily partisan, and so he chose Burger who was also conservative but did not show too much partisanship. He was a constructionist and occasionally showed quite a bit of judicial activism in the court which is what Nixon wanted especially when he was trying to build support for the Vietnam war. The Burger Court in general is known as one of the last liberal courts, and was the transitional court between the heavy liberalism in the Warren court to the heavy conservatism in the Rehnquist court.

                            Justice Byron White wrote a concurring opinion and joined the majority in his vote. He wrote that just the ninth and tenth grades didn’t amount to the importance of the Amish religious practices. He also wrote that if the children who were removed from school did not oppose it as well, then the government has no right to stop them from leaving.

                            Justice William O. Douglas technically voted with the majority but did dissent in part specifically for the part where the right to the children's freedom of religion is entirely given to the parents, and not the children. Although this is significant since this could very well happen in cases in the future, it isn’t necessary for this case since the children did admit to leave school purely for their religion not due their parents. Justice White pointed this out, and it is the reason why he concurred, rather than dissented in part with Justice Douglas.

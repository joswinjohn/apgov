                        On December 16, 1965, John Tinker, Mary Beth Tinker, Hope Tinker, and Paul Tinker along with Christiphor Eckhardt, wore black armbands to school with peace symbols on them to protest against the war. They are told by faculty that the school will not allow them to wear them, but they continue to wear them, in which the principal responds by suspending them all until they return without the armbands.

                        Earl Warren was Republican but was very bipartisan, often supporting liberal points and conservative ones. Warren's court is known to be one of the most liberal supreme courts. The heavy liberalism in the Warren court is part of why this case did not have a similar ruling to the Schenck v. United States case which put nationalism and support for the war over certain constitutional rights.

They decided this way since the students in question did not disrupt other students or interfere with the schoolâ€™s work.

                            Justice Hugo L. Black dissented, writing that The first amendment does not give people the right to express their opinions at any time and uses a precedent case to support that. In this case specifically the armbands may have distracted other students and school officials, and so the school was legally allowed to discipline the students. Justice Harlan wrote a much shorter dissenting opinion. He argued that the school officials do have authority over the students, and so they can deal with them accordingly to keep order in the school.

                    The Tinker v. Des Moines case set a precedent that is still in effect today, and is cited by several other major supreme court cases, including Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier and Morse v. Frederick. The ruling from this case still prevents schools from punishing students for protesting, which is why public protests like the mass school walkouts after the uvalde shooting were legal.

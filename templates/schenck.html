                        In 1917 The general secretary of the socialist party of America, Charles Schenck printed out over 15,000 copies of a paper that said the draft for WWI was unconstitutional and violated the 13th amendment, and so people should resist the draft. He distributed them from Philadelphia, and amassed a large number of people to sit back and not join the war. By doing this Schenck was supposedly violating The Espionage act of 1917 which gave the government the power to incriminate anyone who publicly criticized the war or tried to dissolve the draft, and so he was detained by the federal government along with his colleague Elizabeth Baer.

                        Chief Justice Edward Douglass White was heavily conservative, along with his court. Conservatism in the supreme court was a trend in the early 1900s to the 1930s. Justice White also supported selective drafting in the Selective Draft cases. His court was not as conservative as previous courts, but was still generally conservative.

                            Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote the majority opinion for the unanimous decision, writing that the Espionage act is constitutional, and did not violate the first amendment. He defended his argument by writing that the first amendment only protected free speech when it did not create a “clear and present danger” to the nation. He believes that a major opposition to the draft would hinder the United States Armed Forces during WWI and in turn would create a sense of danger.

                            Justice William O. Douglas technically voted with the majority but did dissent in part specifically for the part where the right to the children's freedom of religion is entirely given to the parents, and not the children. Although this is significant since this could very well happen in cases in the future, it isn’t necessary for this case since the children did admit to leave school purely for their religion not due their parents. Justice White pointed this out, and it is the reason why he concurred, rather than dissented in part with Justice Douglas.

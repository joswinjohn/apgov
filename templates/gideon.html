                        Clarence Earl Gideon was a man who was charged for stealing cash from a store in Florida. The state of Florida provided a trial but not a lawyer to defend him, and so he was left to fend himself. With his minimal knowledge of the law he was sentenced to prison for 5 years in which he began to learn more about the law, and realized that not being provided with a lawyer goes directly against the 6th Amendment. He wrote a letter to the U.S. Supreme Court asking for if they could hear his case. The court agreed and gave him the future Supreme Court lawyer Abe Fortas.

                        Justice Earl Warren was Republican but was very bipartisan, often supporting liberal points and conservative ones. Warren’s court is known to be one of the most liberal supreme courts. The political alignment of this court likely did not contribute too much to the topic of this case as both sides of the line would mostly agree with the decision made, hence the unanimous decision.

                    The court voted unanimously in favor of reversing the decision of the Florida Supreme Court. This decision Selectively incorporated the 6th Amendment, ensuring that all defendants have the right to an attorney, no matter their financial situation.

                            Justice Hugo L. Black wrote the opinion of the court, writing that courts must give an attorney for the accused if requested, even if they cannot afford it. Justice Black also makes several references to the precedent case, Betts v. Brady, which did not entirely incorporate the 6th amendment, only leaving “Assistance of Counsel” for “special cases”.

                                    Our state and national constitutions and laws have laid great emphasis on procedural and substantive safeguards designed to assure fair trials before impartial tribunals in which every defendant stands equal before the law. This noble ideal cannot be realized if the poor man charged with crime has to face his accusers without a lawyer to assist him.

                    Gideon v. Wainwright overturned Powell v. Alabama which declared that defendants would only be appointed an attorney for capital offenses, and not for any other case. It also overturned Betts v. Brady which said that defendants would only be appointed an attorney for “special cases”.

                <div class="mt-4 mb-3">
                    The rights that were incorporated in the Gideon v. Wainwright were later expanded upon by Argersinger v. Hamlin which ensured that a defendant could not be taken to prison unless they are provided with the “Assistance of Counsel” in the case that it's needed.

                        A group of families who had students from the Herricks Union Free School District came together to argue 
                        against the prayer. They argued that its religious connotations aligned specifically with christianity, 
                        and so it favored one religion over another, mostly due to the part of the prayer that states, “Almighty God”. 
                        Steven I. Engel, a Jewish man who did not agree with the Board of Regents decision, led their attempt and sued 
                        the school board president William J. Vitale. Engel gained the support of many Jewish organizations and others 
                        who wanted to remove prayers from public schools.

                        because of the heavy liberalism in the Warren court that so many civil rights rulings created new acts to

                            Justice Hugo L. Black wrote the majority opinion for this case, writing on the behalf of Warren, Douglas, 
                            Clark, Harlan, and Brennan, stating that prayers cannot be held in public schools because the First Amendment 
                            prevented the enactment of any law "respecting an establishment of religion," and that Vitale's prayers violated 
                            the said establishment clause. Justice Black argued that the policy breached the separation between the church and 
                            state. He even used trends in American history to prove his point, for example:

                            Justice William O. Douglas gave a concurring opinion, stating that even though the students may not be forced to 
                            perform the prayer, the teacher is, and the teacher is a public official who is on payroll from the government. 
                            He believes that this infringes on our first amendment rights because the government is indirectly funding this 
                            by paying the one reciting the prayer, in turn tying religion to our government. Justice Douglas quotes his own 
                            dissenting opinion from a previous case on the first amendment.

                            our nation. He then gives several examples in which references to God have been used by our government, while keeping

                    The case did not overturn any precedent cases but it did ensure that the government does not have the right to create and/or 
                    enforce anyone to perform a prayer or any other religious motion. It also ensured that the government could not sponsor religious 
                    programs, which is part of why teachers who are paid by the government in public schools cannot hold prayers.
                </div>

                <div class="mt-4 pb-5">
                    The Engel v. Vitale ruling has held for decades, and has prevented schools from establishing prayers, but recently There has been 
                    a US Supreme Court Case that may overturn this precedent. The Kennedy v. Bremerton School District case involved a football coach 
                    who held a voluntary prayer for his players before games after school. The school district tried to stop him from doing so, fearing 
                    a lawsuit, but Kennedy instead sued the school district for violating his First Amendment rights and Title VII of the Civil Rights 
                    Act of 1964 which prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, etc. This case resulted in a 6-3 vote in 
                    favor of Kennedy, and allowed him to recite prayers with his players. The ruling suggests that teachers can hold prayers with their 
                    students as long as it's after school, although the teacher is still paid by the government when the prayers are said, which 
                    counteracts the ruling in Engel v. Vitale.

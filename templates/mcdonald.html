                        Otis McDonald was a man who lived in a high crime area of Chicago typically ridden over by various gangs, and so his home had been robbed 5 separate times. McDonald owned several guns for hunting but none of which were very reliable in the case of a break in. Chicago at the time had very restrictive handgun laws, and so McDonald didn’t have a great way to protect his property. McDonald argued in court saying that the previous District of Columbia v. Heller case assured that putting a ban on guns was unconstitutional since it violated the second amendment. His case was dismissed in the district court, and he lost in the circuit court, so appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court and was given a hearing for his case on Mar 2, 2010.

                        Chief Justice Warren Burger was selected by President Nixon who although conservative was not heavily partisan, and so he chose Burger who was also conservative but did not show too much partisanship. Justice Burger and his court were slightly liberal but because they were the transitional court from the extremely liberal Warren court to the extremely conservative Rehnquist Court they were very bipartisan.

                            The decision for the New York Times Co. v. United States was a writ of Certiorari to the U.S. court of appeals for the district of Columbia, and was a per curiam decision written collectively by the court. It agreed with the decision made by the appellate court, which was that the publishing and public distribution of the released documents was protected under the first amendment. Justice Black writes in his concurring opinion,

                            Justice Black explains that for the President to use his powers to violate the first amendment is exactly what destroys the security of the people, even though he is violating it for what he claims is security for the people. He later explains that the word security itself is too vague to be used in this case, and disregarding the first amendment for it isn’t an action the court should take.

The whistleblower who released information on Trump's call with a foreign leader during the 2020 elections, was legally allowed to release information publicly because of this case, although he did remain anonymous.
